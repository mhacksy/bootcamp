        <h1>Snakes</h1>
        <p>Snakes are some of the most feared animals, up there with spiders and centipedes for many. Some people even suffer from ophidiophobia, an intense fear of snakes. This fear is not unfounded. Our bodies have evolved to fear animals that could potentially harm us, and some snakes certainly can be deadly.</p>

        <h1>The Importance of Italian Cuisine</h1>
        <p>Italian cuisine (Italian: Cucina italiana) is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora. Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet â€” the latter introduced in quantity in the 18th century. It is one of the best-known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide.</p>
       
        <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta">Spaghetti</a> is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.</p>
